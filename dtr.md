Project: Complete Me

## Group Member Names:  Megan McMahon, Anna Royer

## Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

## We want to :
* Learn how to create and manipulate a trie
* Become more sufficient at using github
* Gaining familiarity with spec harness and SimpleCov
* Practicing TDD
* Understand how to work with another person on a code project

## Goals and expectations:
* Get through all required methods
* Write quality, readable code
* Get 100% on simplecov
* at least one edge case test for each method
* Sharing work evenly
* Both partners will thoroughly understand and be able to explain every part of the code
* Have mvp completed by Tuesday noon, so there is a buffer for issues and refactor
* Get more comfortable recognizing our own strengths
* Finish basic interaction model by Monday
* Complete usage waiting by Tuesday noon
* If we get by Usage Waiting by Monday, then each partner will take one of the support features, otherwise, we'll treat usage waiting as a support feature, and one of us will take that on and the other will do a support feature

## Team strengths:
* Thorough thought processes
* Focused on quality

## How to overcome obstacles:
* if we aren't making progess on an obstacle after 30 minutes, then we find help
* address immediately
* daily updates; personal & work
* revisit during DTR during retro, make updates as necessary

## Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):
* leave Turing campus by 8 pm every night
* work this weekend in person
* tonight we individually play around with the project and get an idea of how we can implement this in code
* set up spec harness, simple cov and project directory this afternoon
* Saturday 10 am ~ 1 or 2 pm in Boulder
* Sunday at Turing noon - night
* Monday and Tuesday after school

## Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):
* standup at the beginning of each work session
* retro at the end
* when we do work individually, send a quick update to partner of what you did
* slack will be primary remote communication tool

## Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
* Improve writing nice clean code
* Improve testing
* Megan: strong understanding of conditionals
* Practice writing quality object oriented design
*Anna: strong understanding of recursion

## Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
* For this project, mostly pair programming, because iterations build on themselves
* Each partner could focus on one of the support features
* If we reach the extensions, we could each pick which extensions we would like to focus on

## Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):
* When a branch is pushed, the other person is responsible for merging and reviewing
* Always make one suggestion before merging new branch

## Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
* Be kind to each other
* Provide only constructive feedback
* Communicate when we feel the other partner is stepping on our toes

## Agenda to discuss project launch:
* Have mvp completed by Tuesday noon, so there is a buffer for issues and refactor
* Finish basic interaction model by Monday
* Complete usage waiting by Tuesday noon
* If we get by Usage Waiting by Monday, then each partner will take one of the support features, otherwise, we'll treat usage waiting as a support feature, and one of us will take that on and the other will do a support feature
* Official kick -off directly after cohort retro Friday
* Wednesday evening, project close-out

Ideas:

## Tools:
* you tube videos
* ruby docs
* upper mods
* mentors
